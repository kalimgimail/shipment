        The ... spread operator is a feature in JavaScript and TypeScript that allows you to 
        spread the elements of an iterable (like an array) into another array or object. 
        It provides a concise way to copy, merge, or create new arrays or objects based 
        on existing ones.
        (...) The spread operator is a powerful tool for working with arrays and objects 
        in a more convenient and readable way. It's widely used in modern JavaScript 
        and TypeScript for tasks like array manipulation, function arguments, and object cloning.
