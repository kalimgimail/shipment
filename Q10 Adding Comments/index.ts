    Question: Adding Comments

    Description:
        Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. 
        If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple 
        at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. 
        Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// This program stores favorite number in a variable
// and using that variable displays a messge to the end user, 
// and guided him what is my favorite number

// 1. program
// const is used because don't want to change the variable 
// so its nature and fixed and no one can change its value.
const favoriteNumber = 0            

// using a message to the end user , i am trying to communicate him
// what is my favoriate number, and making all this statement as literal
// and displays it inline syntax to display over screen.
console.log ( `My Favorite Number is : ${favoriteNumber} `)



// 2. program
// Q6. Stripping Names
// using the builtin features of the typescript, clean data
// was a greate work, to understand the strong areas over string data
// how to apply filters, slit & join them and using the 
// callback functionality how to navigate throug data, 
// it was fun to learn, and its a greate tool to work on future
// using map & callback & slice & split & join, with clean the data 
// from whitespaces was a fun.
